# 01 Exercises: Intro

Before considering the technical aspects of XR development, we should explore the ideas and motivations behind the technology. That is, this week we will focus on "what" and "why" - the following weeks we will explore "how".

Create a blog and write your first post (1-2 pages, one page is considered 2400 characters) covering the "what" and the "why" of XR. Here are some questions you can use for inspiration:

-   What is AR/VR/AV/MR/XR and how do the terminologies compare?
-   How do XR applications compare to traditional desktop and mobile applications? Advantages/disadvantages?
-   What use cases does XR have?
-   How does XR add value to the end user?
-   How does current XR technology compare to an idealistic future vision of the technology?
-   How does immersion and presence factor into XR?
-   How is input technology and interactions different in XR?
-   What problems can XR solve?

When you are done, share your blog [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oRGYzbkY8VtLzHrI8_UcwEKSGPI_6vYIuzou5vK2sFI/edit#gid=249153240).
