# 02 Exercises: AR Development

# :construction: Under Construction :construction:

## 1. Set Up Your Development Environment

To get started on the exercises, you will need to have a few things set up and ready:

-   Install the latest official release of [Unity](https://unity.com/download). Make sure you install the same version as your team for future collaboration.
-   Add the Android/iOS build support module depending on what device you have access to (building for iOS requires a Mac).
-   Set up Rider, Visual Studio Code or any other C# IDE of your choice

## 2. Create A New AR Project

Use the AR template in Unity Hub to get started.

> N.B.: You can also enable AR Foundation in an existing project:
>
> -   Project settings > XR Plugin Management > "Install XR Plugin Management"
> -   Toogle Google ARCore (installs AR Foundation and ARCore provider plugin)
> -   Accept the restart to enable the new input system

Before you begin developing, go to Project Settings and enable ARCore for Android or ARKit for iOS.

For more information about the AR template, you can refer to [the documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.template.ar@4.0/manual/index.html).
